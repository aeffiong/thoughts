# Thoughts Tracker

Thoughts Tracker is a simple Vue application that makes use of the Vuex store to store data across the application and Vue router for single page application routing. The application starts on a homepage where you click to the next page to write down a thought you have. After you save your thought, you can go back to the Home page, return to the Thoughts page, and your thoughts will still be there. Thoughts go away when you refresh the application.
